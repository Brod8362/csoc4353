# Development Methodology

Our team will be using the Agile Development Methodology because we can break the tasks into short sprints. This helps us create multiple tests during the development of the project and encourages us to communicate to each other on our progress. The pros of using Agile is that we can easily address if there are changes in project requirements, we can communicate frequently and be transparent with each other, and there will be less errors made due to our constant fine-tuning during testing.
