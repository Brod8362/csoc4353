# Development Methodology

Our team will be using the Kanban Development Methodology because we can visualize our workflow on the board easily by utilizing color-coded tags and the calendar view. There will be 5 tags that will be attached to each Kanboard card or task: backend is brown, database is green, documentation is gray, frontend is yellow, and testing is orange.

Our board will be divided between five different stages: Todo, Planning, Development, Testing, and Done.

Each teammate may see each other's tasks and progress on each step, which allows a fluid and transparent development process within the team. The tasks are marked by their corresponding tags and the name of a teammate. The cards also keep track of the creation, modification, andmovement of the task as it moves across the four stages.

Some notable pros of Kanban is that it allows for continuous flow and allows changes can be made at any time. It is also quite flexible as it does not impose strict constraints or meetings. You can also add deadlines, notes, and options to upload files, links, and even documentsto the cards. 

On Github, each teammate will create a branch specific to their tasks in order to make concurrent changes without messing up the flow of the project. Once the tasks are committed, each teammate makes a pull request to the main branch and is reviewed before being accepted or denied. Back on the kanboard, once the pull request is approved, the task will be dropped into the Done column.
