# Application Design
The application will need to be designed in a way that allows the user to input their data and immediately receive a predicted value. 
First, the user would have to login or register with the application, and then input the necessary criteria of location, gallons requested, and company profit margin.
The application would then predict the rate of fuel based on the user submitted data, and would display them to the user in a pricing module. This fuel rate will also be stored into the database for future reference by the user. 

Our team will divide the project into three major stages for better management of necessary features, focusing on the frontend, backend, and database of the system.
We will be using Github as our main collaboration tool, as well as Kanboard to manage the necessary tasks that need to be completed for each stage of the project.
